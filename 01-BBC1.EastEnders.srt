1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,570
        - Yes, I do.            
        - (laughs)              

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,906
      My mom doesn't want       
      to babysit everyday       

3
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:09,274
        or any day.             

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,977
        But I need              
    my mom's help sometimes.    

5
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:14,046
        She's just gonna        
    have to be grandma today.   

6
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,647
        - You might             
    have to help me here.       

7
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,217
    - Oh, see? You gotta        
    get on your job.            

8
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,385
    - Am I gonna                
    be on the payroll?          

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,687
        - What I paid           
        into this house,        

10
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,756
                that was salary.

11
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,224
    Why should I                
have to pay you to watch him?   

12
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,426
    I thought most grandmas     
        did it for free.        

13
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,061
        - This one work         
        with an app.            

14
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,529
        I should have           
    kept this one myself        

15
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,530
    and gave you the other one. 

16
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,799
        - Mm-hmm.               
    He is just too cute.        

17
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,267
    He looks just like me.      

18
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,169
    - Everybody keeps saying    
    he look like Riley.         

19
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,904
    - Well, Riley look like me. 

20
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,305
        - I don't know.         

21
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,707
    Speaking of Riley,          

22
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,009
      her dad's girlfriend      

23
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:46,645
    popped up at the studio     
        the other day.          

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,713
    - I've been saying to Block,

25
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,448
    why won't you               
    reach out to Riley?         

26
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,917
    Maybe he knows the vibe     
    from you to him.            

27
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:52,951
    - He made it that way.      

28
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:55,854
    I haven't seen her in years.

29
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,322
    I haven't talked to him     

30
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:59,358
    in like two years,          
    something like that.        

31
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,393
    - I would have said,        
    did you bring the check?    

32
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:05,330
        Because you know he owes
        pretty close to $50,000.

33
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:06,799
                Now which one   
        would he rather have,   

34
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,534
      a lien on his house       

35
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,103
    or his driver's license     
        taken?                  

36
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,072
    If I was in Kandi's shoes,  

37
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:16,442
    I would have him do an LLC: 

38
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,943
    lien, license, or cash?     

39
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:20,512
        Simple as that.         

40
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,082
- But I don't even want to      
make this about a money thing.  

41
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:25,984
    That part doesn't even      
    matter to me at this point. 

42
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,455
    Block is a successful       
    music industry vet          

43
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,423
        who has money.          

44
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,591
        Of course               
    I could take care of Riley, 

45
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,860
        but I still think       
        as her father           

46
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,161
    he should do his part.      

47
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:38,330
        The child support       
        is what it is.          

48
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,732
        It would be nice        
        if he paid it.          

49
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:41,934
      It ain't that much,       

50
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,135
    because he lie about how    
    much money he had in court, 

51
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,269
                which, whatever.

52
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:45,504
        But now                 
    he don't even pay that.     

53
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,272
        It's like come on, dawg.

54
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,640
      What is the problem?      

55
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:49,842
        - People                
    take advantage of you       

56
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:52,077
        'cause you just         
        try to be sweet.        

57
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:55,080
    - What was I supposed to do,
    blast his ass on the radio? 

58
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,582
    "Cause I've been wanting to 
        for years now.          

59
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,817
        Every time              
    he get on the radio,        

60
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,986
        telling them,           
    I'm the million dollar boy. 

61
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,955
        Old Block love the kids.

62
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,756
        I be wanting            
    to call in on his ass.      

63
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,893
    Your dead meat ass          
    does not love kids.         

64
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,262
    - Now, don't you know what  
    your mama would have did?   

65
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,330
    You should have said, hello.

66
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,099
    Your ass don't pay          
    damn child support.         

67
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:15,300
    - See, I can't do that.     

68
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,136
    - Yes, hell, you can do it. 

69
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,638
      He is gonna pay it.       

70
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,640
    Or else he just do          
    like he been doing,         

71
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,108
    keep his ass away.          

72
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,244
      - Okay. It's just...      

73
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,678
            (sighs)             

74
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:29,414
                I did tell Riley

75
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,483
      that girl showed up,      

76
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,185
        and I asked Riley       
        how she felt.           

77
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,854
                - I feel like   
        he should be the one,   

78
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,756
      not his girlfriend.       

79
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,458
        - I agree.              

80
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,161
        - You don't wait        
    till she gets 13 years old  

81
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,897
    and then now you wanna      
step up and be daddy dearest.   

82
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,167
    - At this point,            
    Riley's old enough          

83
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:49,368
    to say whether or not       

84
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,936
    she really want to have     
    a relationship with her dad.

85
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,504
            Right now,          
      she ain't feeling it,     

86
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,706
        so I'm not going to push

87
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:58,110
    and I'm not going to dis    
        the relationship.       

88
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,580
        - You do right          
        by my daughter.         

89
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,183
    Ain't nothing good          
    gonna happen to you.        

90
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:06,318
    - Is that what you did?     
    - I did it.                 

91
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,420
        I did it.               
        - (laughs)              

92

    you didn't see a drink      

94
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,526
    that you didn't want        
    to throw back.              

95
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,261
    - Don't tell those lies now.

96
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,863
      Wait for the courtroom    
            for that.           

97
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,431
        But anyway, so...       

98
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,599
        - No, she didn't.       

99
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,034
        - You haven't even      
                apologized      

100
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,802
    or owned up to the stuff

        You look good.          
        Nice to see you.        

128
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,351
        - We look alike.        
        - Oh, I know.           

129
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,887
                We do have      
        similar colors on.      

130
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,456
    Hell is frosty              
    because Kenya and I         

131
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,858
        are actually            
        in a good place.        

132
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,660
        - Oh, my gosh,          
    I have those at home.       

133
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,395
      - They're beautiful.      

134
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,530
    - Those are blooming teas.  

135
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,432
        - I'm taking baby steps.

136
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,901
    No need for                 
a friendship contract just yet. 

137
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,270
    Well, Phaedra, when you     
    invite me to your home,     

138
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:18,570
    you can serve me that.      

139
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:22,474
    - Okay. I                   

140
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,009
    you - I love it. that.      

141
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,477
    Come on, we're talking      
    about Phaedra Parks.        

142
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:26,945
    All I'm hoping for          

143
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,346
    is that that voodoo doll    
    that she keeps of me        

144
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,481
        in the back             
        of her drawer,          

145
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,850
    that she just takes         
    a few of those pins out.    

146
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:34,986
    - Well, I was thinking      
    about that mystery house.   

147
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,721
        We really beat you guys.

148
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,291
- Well, I mean, we really were  
only playing with two players.  

149
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,659
    Oh, look in the goggles     
        in there.               

150
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,726
    - I think my hair too big.  

151
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:42,828
        Porsha,                 
    you got to put them on.     

152
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,796
    - Let me see, okay.         
    Girl, my lashes.            

153
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,199
- You and Porsha?               
- I mean, no, me and Cynthia.   

154
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,800
    - Don't be shady.           
    - I'm just saying.          

155
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:51,603
Well, you told me that the whole
        point of her inviting us

156
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,039
        was to tell us          
    about her anger management, 

157
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,707
    and she didn't say          
    anything about it.          

158
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,776
    - But no issues             
    in the room, right?         

159
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,112
        - No, I mean,           
    we came there to play nice. 

160
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,948
                I was, you know,

161
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,816
    at least a little           
    encouraged to be there      

162
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,952
    knowing that steps          
    were being taken            

163
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,922
for her to control her,         
you know, violent tendencies.   

164
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,024
    - Oh, God.                  
    - And I'm like, okay.       

165
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,092
    - She is no Rick Flair.     

166
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,061
        She is not just         
    whupping up on the people.  

167
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,564
    - Just some bitches.        
    She has--Just some what?    

168
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,169
        - No, I didn't.         
        (laughs)                

169
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,670
        - Girl, bye.            

170
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,606
    I heard you got sassy       
        with Sheree.            

171
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:28,974
    - I got sassy with Sheree?  

172
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,041
    - That's what I heard.      

173
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,076
    You called her the B word.  

174
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,577
    - Oh, no, I didn't.         
    - You didn't?               

175
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:33,945
    - I just said no bitch      
    is going to tell me         

176
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,046
    what to do in my house.     

177
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,649
    That is not me              
    calling her a bitch.        

178
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,052
    - So what was it, then?     

179
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,621
    - It was a generalization.  

180
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:43,855
        - Are you going         
        to apologize?           

181
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,357
        - What do I need        
        to apologize for?       

182
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,225
    She was the one             
    trashing my house.          

183
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,393
        - All right.            

184
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,928
        - Yes, so I mean,       
    that's what that was about, 

185
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,429
        so I don't feel         
        any type of way.        

186
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:55,166
    I am still on cloud nine    
    from Matt's family reunion. 

187
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,968
        I have my man,          
        I have my manor,        

188
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,537
            and Sheree          
      can take several seats    

189
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:02,607
if she actually had furniture   
    in her empty house.         

190
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,510
    - Really what I want        
    to discuss is my camp.      

191
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:06,912
        - Okay.                 
        - In Michigan,          

192
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,581
            and since           
      you are Miss Michigan,    

193
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:12,584
            I'm sure            
      you have good ideas.      

194
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:16,388
I began the Phaedra Foundation  
    a few years ago             

195
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:19,858
    when I saw a need in the    
    community for a mentorship. 

196
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,461
    This is my son, and he      
    is who I'm concerned about, 

197
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:26,798
    as well as you guys,        
and the change begins with us.  

198
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,066
    I've been very active       

199
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,135
    in the whole Flint,         
    Michigan water crisis.      

200
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,404
        Now I want to do        
        an overnight camp       

201
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:36,041
specifically for children       
affected by the water crisis.   

202
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,977
It's going to be a partnership  
    with the YMCA.              

203
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,211
    - I learned to swim         
        at a YMCA.              

204
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,212
        - Oh, my gosh.          

205
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,480
    So would you be interested  

206
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:43,848
        in helping out          
        with the camp?          

207
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:44,916
    - That'll be cool.          

208
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,551
Maybe I could teach the girls   
    how to dance.               

209
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:47,852
        - Oh, yes.              

210
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,488
    - You know what I always    
    really wanted to do         

211
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:51,623
    is like table manners.      

212
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:52,657
        - I love it.            

213
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,392
    Kenya's crazy as a bed bug, 

214
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,827
    but at the end of the day,  

215
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,996
    I can't take away           
    her accomplishments.        

216
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,231
    She did earn the title      
    of Miss Somebody Important.
