<i>Must we die?</i>

<i>Are there beings in the cosmos</i>

<i>Our ancestors</i>
<i>marked the passage of time</i>

7
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:09,244
<i>by the Moon and stars.</i>

8
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:40,308
But it was the people
who once lived here,

9
00:02:40,342 --> 00:02:42,310
around 5,000 years ago,

10
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:44,145
who first starting
chopping up time

11
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,049
into smaller bite-sized portions
of hours and minutes.

12
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,485
They call this place Uruk.

13
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,521
We call it Iraq.

14
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:55,256
It's a part of Mesopotamia,

15
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,793
the land between the Tigris
and the Euphrates rivers.

16
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,366
The city was invented here.

17
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,935
And one of humanity's
greatest victories was won

18
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,371
in the ceaseless battle
against time.

19
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:12,407
It was here that we learned
how to write.

20
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,709
Death could
no longer silence us.

21
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:16,745
And writing gave us the power

22
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,847
to reach across the millennia

23
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:21,583
and speak inside the heads
of the living.

24
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:23,852
<i>No one has ever spoken</i>

25
00:03:23,886 --> 00:03:26,021
<i>across a longer stretch</i>
<i>of time's river</i>

26
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,722
<i>than this Akkadian princess,</i>

27
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:30,191
<i>daughter of the first emperor</i>
<i>in history,</i>

28
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:33,428
<i>and priestess of the Moon--</i>
<i>Enheduanna.</i>

29
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:35,897
<i>For not only</i>
<i>did she write poetry,</i>

30
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:37,065
<i>but Enheduanna did something</i>

31
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,701
<i>no one before her</i>
<i>had ever done--</i>

32
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:42,237
<i>she signed her name</i>
<i>to her work.</i>

33
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:44,439
<i>She's the first person</i>
<i>for whom we can say</i>

34
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:46,408
<i>we know who she was,</i>

35
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:48,309
<i>and what she dreamed.</i>

36
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:52,247
<i>She dreamt of stepping</i>
<i>through the Gate of Wonder.</i>

37
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,949
<i>Here's a thought</i>
<i>Enheduanna sent</i>

38
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,952
<i>across more than 4,000 years</i>
<i>to you.</i>

39
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,488
<i>It's from her work entitled</i>

40
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,824
Lady of the Largest Heart.

41
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,798
<i>Innana, the planet Venus,</i>

42
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,168
<i>goddess of love,</i>
<i>will have a great destiny</i>

43
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:16,237
<i>throughout the entire universe.</i>

44
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:19,140
<i>...throughout</i>
<i>the entire universe.</i>

45
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,977
And Uruk is also the place
where the epic tale

46
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,512
of "The Hero's Journey"
was first written down.

47
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:27,315
Before Batman, Luke Skywalker,

48
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,417
Odysseus-- before them all--

49
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:32,754
there was a man named Gilgamesh

50
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:36,524
<i>who left home on a quest</i>
<i>to vanquish time.</i>

51
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:39,594
<i>Gilgamesh was searching</i>
<i>for immortality.</i>

52
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:42,030
<i>He looked everywhere,</i>

53
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:43,865
<i>gained complete wisdom,</i>

54
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,634
<i>uncovered what was hidden.</i>

55
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:50,438
<i>He brought back a tale of times</i>
<i>before the Great Flood.</i>

56
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:53,508
<i>He built the Wall of Uruk,</i>

57
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:56,811
<i>which no future king</i>
<i>will ever match.</i>

58
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:59,347
<i>Read the story</i>
<i>of that man Gilgamesh,</i>

59
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,850
<i>a hero born of Uruk,</i>

60
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,486
<i>who went through all kinds</i>
<i>of sufferings.</i>

61
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,954
<i>Who crossed the ocean,</i>

62
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:08,890
<i>the broad seas,</i>
<i>as far as the sunrise;</i>

63
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:10,859
<i>who inspected</i>
<i>the edges of the world,</i>

64
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,395
<i>searching for eternal life.</i>

65
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:14,863
<i>On his travels,</i>

66
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,066
<i>Gilgamesh encountered</i>
<i>a wise man named Utnapishtim,</i>

67
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,736
<i>who told him the story of a</i>
<i>flood that destroyed the world,</i>

68
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:24,839
<i>and how one of the gods</i>
<i>instructed Utnapishtim</i>

69
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:29,544
<i>to build an ark to rescue</i>
<i>his family and the animals.</i>

70
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,513
<i>The earliest surviving account</i>
<i>of the flood legend</i>

71
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:07,549
was written down in Mesopotamia,

72
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,118
a thousand years
before it was retold

73
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:12,854
as the story of Noah
in the Old Testament.

74
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:14,923
So, you could say Gilgamesh

75
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,125
fulfilled his quest
for immortality.

76
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:20,128
We still read
the<i> Epic of Gilgamesh,</i>

77
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:23,098
and with every reader,
he lives again.

78
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,534
And all those heroes and
superheroes who have come since

79
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:30,472
follow in the footsteps
of the first hero's journey--

80
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:33,441
another kind of immortality;

81
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,544
a story sent from one
civilization to another

82
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,880
across thousands of years.

83
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:42,117
But life itself sends
its own stories

84
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,486
across billions of years.

85
00:06:47,923 --> 00:06:50,992
It's a message that every
one of us carries inside,

86
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:53,762
inscribed in all the cells
of our bodies,

87
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:57,232
in a language that all life
on Earth can read.

88
00:06:57,266 --> 00:07:00,568
The genetic code
is written in an alphabet

89
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,170
consisting of only four letters.

90
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:06,074
Each letter is
a molecule made of atoms;

91
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:08,643
each word is three letters long.

92
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,447
Every living thing is
a masterpiece,

93
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:15,617
written by nature
and edited by evolution;

94
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,286
the instructions
for running and reproducing

95
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,755
the intricate machinery of life.

96
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,857
The essential message of life

97
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:26,628
has been copied and recopied
for more than 3 billion years.

98
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:29,497
But where did
that message come from?

99
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,800
Nobody knows.

100
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,613
Perhaps it began in a shallow,
sunlit pool, just like this.

101
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:47,515
Somehow, carbon-rich molecules

102
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,119
began using energy to make
crude copies of themselves.

103
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:53,989
Some varieties were
better at making copies,

104
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:55,657
and left more offspring.

105
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:58,994
The competing molecules
became more elaborate.

106
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:02,864
Evolution and life itself
was underway.

107
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,469
<i>Or life could've started</i>

108
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:10,639
<i>in the searing heat</i>
<i>of a volcanic vent</i>

109
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:12,607
<i>on the deep sea floor.</i>

110
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:19,681
<i>Or is it possible</i>
<i>that life came to Earth</i>

111
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:21,549
<i>as a hitchhiker?</i>

112
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,551
<i>Let me tell you a story</i>

113
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,720
<i>about a traveler</i>
<i>from another world.</i>

114
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,596
<i>The peace of the Egyptian</i>
<i>village of Nakhla,</i>

115
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,930
<i>near Alexandria,</i>

116
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:39,868
<i>was abruptly shattered</i>
<i>on a June morning in 1911.</i>

117
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:55,717
<i>Written in this meteorite was</i>

118
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:58,086
<i>a message from another planet.</i>

119
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,088
<i>But 70 years would pass</i>

120
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,457
<i>before anyone could read it.</i>

121
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:07,696
<i>In 1976,</i>

122
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,267
<i>NASA landed two Viking</i>
<i>spacecraft on Mars.</i>

123
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,868
<i>Carl Sagan took us there</i>

124
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:16,805
<i>on our original journey</i>
<i>through the cosmos.</i>

125
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,573
<i>We found that the Martian air</i>

126
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:20,809
<i>was less than one percent</i>
<i>as dense as ours,</i>

127
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:23,244
<i>and made mostly</i>
<i>of carbon dioxide.</i>

128
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,114
<i>There were smaller amounts</i>
<i>of nitrogen,</i>

129
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,884
<i>argon, water vapor and oxygen.</i>

130
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,419
<i>A few years later,</i>

131
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:33,955
<i>when scientists thought</i>
<i>to analyze the gasses</i>

132
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,957
<i>trapped inside</i>
<i>the Nakhla meteorite,</i>

133
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,993
<i>and other members of its class,</i>

134
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:40,228
<i>they found</i>
<i>a striking similarity--</i>

135
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:42,297
<i>the vast majority of meteorites</i>

136
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,566
<i>are fragments of asteroids.</i>

137
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,269
<i>But the kind</i>
<i>that hit Nakhla, on Earth,</i>

138
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:50,705
<i>could only have come</i>
<i>from one place...</i>

139
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:03,718
Mars.

140
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,648
<i>Welcome to Mars.</i>

141
00:10:14,754 --> 00:10:17,989
Over a billion years ago,
a volcano erupted here

142
00:10:18,023 --> 00:10:20,792
and its lava cooled
into solid rock.

143
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:23,061
Hundreds of millions
of years later,

144
00:10:23,095 --> 00:10:26,097
this area was flooded
with water.

145
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:27,766
And long after that flood,

146
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,135
an asteroid the size of
the Rock of Gibraltar

147
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:32,804
crashed into
the Martian surface,

148
00:10:32,838 --> 00:10:34,839
blasting out a huge crater.

149
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:41,746
Much of the debris was ejected
back out into space,

150
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:44,582
where it orbited the Sun
until a gravitational tug

151
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:47,752
from its home planet, Mars,
diverted one of the boulders

152
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:50,255
into a collision course
with Earth.

153
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:54,426
Its arrival shook up
the little village of Nakhla.

154
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,095
Meteorites of the type that
hit Nakhla

155
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:01,433
are the vehicles of a natural
interplanetary transit system

156
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:03,868
that sends rocks between
the planets.

157
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:08,306
<i>Such a meteorite can safely</i>
<i>shelter microscopic cargo--</i>

158
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,608
<i>the seeds of life--</i>

159
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:13,278
an interplanetary ark.

160
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:16,948
Most rocks are porous, full of
tiny nooks and crannies,

161
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:19,084
where life can stow away.

162
00:11:22,822 --> 00:11:24,656
<i>We know</i>
<i>that some microbes can survive</i>

163
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,792
<i>the hostile environment</i>
<i>of space.</i>

164
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:30,562
<i>Take these guys, for instance.</i>

165
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:33,798
<i>These microbes spent a year</i>
<i>and a half riding</i>

166
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,367
<i>on the outside of the</i>
<i>International Space Station,</i>

167
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:39,671
<i>exposed to the extreme</i>
<i>temperatures, vacuum,</i>

168
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:41,806
<i>and radiation of space.</i>

169
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:45,009
<i>And some of them</i>
<i>were still alive and kicking</i>

170
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,679
<i>when they were brought back</i>
<i>to Earth.</i>

171
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:50,548
<i>Even more astonishing</i>
<i>are these creatures,</i>

172
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:55,320
<i>awakened from a deathlike sleep</i>
<i>of eight million years.</i>

173
00:11:55,354 --> 00:11:57,655
<i>They were frozen</i>
<i>in the Antarctic ice</i>

174
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,593
<i>millions of years before</i>
<i>our species even existed.</i>

175
00:12:01,627 --> 00:12:03,261
And they're still alive.

176
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:07,932
<i>If life can withstand</i>
<i>the hardships of space</i>

177
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,068
and endure for millennia,

178
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:13,271
then it could ride the natural
interplanetary transit system

179
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:14,873
from world to world.

180
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:17,675
It's a good bet
that our microbial ancestors

181
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,778
spent some time in space.

182
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:21,413
Why do we think so?

183
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:25,050
The Earth is four-and-a-half-
billion-years old.

184
00:12:27,787 --> 00:12:29,621
<i>For the first half</i>
<i>of its lifetime,</i>

185
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:31,556
<i>large asteroids were bombarding</i>
<i>the planet</i>

186
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,692
<i>every few million years.</i>

187
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:38,563
<i>The most violent impacts</i>
<i>vaporized the oceans</i>

188
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:41,132
<i>and even melted</i>
<i>the surface rock.</i>

189
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:43,601
<i>Each such collision would have</i>

190
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:45,269
<i>completely sterilized</i>
<i>the planet</i>

191
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:47,901
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

192
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,876
<i>But we know from fossils</i>
<i>in the rocks</i>

193
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:54,212
<i>that bacteria were evolving</i>
<i>on Earth</i>

194
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:56,448
<i>during this formative period.</i>

195
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:04,489
<i>So how could life have survived</i>
<i>such a lethal series of blows?</i>

196
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:06,057
<i>Whenever one</i>
<i>of those big asteroids</i>

197
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:09,394
hit the Earth, the explosion
would blast out a crater,

198
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:12,497
launching millions of boulders
into space.

199
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:16,434
Many of those rocks carried
living bacteria inside.

200
00:13:16,469 --> 00:13:18,770
Some of the bugs would have
survived in space,

201
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:22,040
while all those left behind
on Earth would have been fried.

202
00:13:22,074 --> 00:13:25,376
A few thousand years
after each impact,

203
00:13:25,411 --> 00:13:27,545
the Earth would have
cooled down enough

204
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,048
for water to condense
into oceans.

205
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:33,852
The planet would again be
habitable.

206
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:37,088
Meanwhile, most of the rocks
launched into space

207
00:13:37,123 --> 00:13:40,959
would have been orbiting
the Sun.

208
00:13:40,993 --> 00:13:44,095
<i>Some of them would encounter</i>
<i>the Earth again,</i>

209
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:47,031
<i>reenter the atmosphere</i>
<i>as meteorites,</i>

210
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:49,534
<i>and deliver their precious</i>
<i>cargo of life</i>

211
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,669
<i>to re-seed the planet...</i>

212
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:55,807
<i>like Noah's ark.</i>

213
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:58,042
<i>What this means is that life</i>
<i>doesn't have</i>

214
00:13:58,077 --> 00:14:02,614
<i>to start over again from</i>
<i>scratch after each catastrophe.</i>

215
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:05,183
<i>It can pick up</i>
<i>where it left off.</i>

216
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:08,219
When the solar system was young,

217
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:10,421
Venus was probably more
like Earth,

218
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:13,591
with oceans and maybe even life.

219
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:16,895
Venus, Earth, and Mars
were all exchanging rocks

220
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:18,830
with each other,
due to asteroid impacts.

221
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:22,000
Does life on Earth carry
any traces

222
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:24,636
of interplanetary voyages
made in the distant past?

223
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,006
Why is it
that some microbes can survive

224
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,409
the intense radiation
and vacuum of space?

225
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:34,779
These conditions don't naturally
exist on Earth.

226
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:36,681
Maybe those bugs are telling us

227
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:40,919
that their ancestors survived
those same conditions in space,

228
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:43,054
a few billion years ago.

229
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,758
So we know that microbes
can stow away in rocks

230
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,494
and survive the voyage
from planet to planet.

231
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:51,996
But what about trip
from star to star--

232
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:54,499
an interstellar odyssey?

233
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:04,430
The dandelion.

234
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:06,899
Around 30 million years ago,

235
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:10,436
it evolved another way to send
its own message of life

236
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:12,805
through space and time.

237
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:23,583
<i>Each seedling</i>
<i>is a little paratrooper,</i>

238
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:25,251
<i>floating on the wind,</i>

239
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:29,288
<i>risking everything</i>
<i>for a safe place to land.</i>

240
00:15:29,323 --> 00:15:33,659
<i>Updrafts can carry them</i>
<i>higher into the air.</i>

241
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:35,094
<i>A dandelion can travel dozens,</i>

242
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:37,163
<i>possibly hundreds</i>
<i>of kilometers,</i>

243
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:41,701
<i>even crossing over</i>
<i>mountain ranges.</i>

244
00:15:41,735 --> 00:15:46,506
<i>Evolution has shaped it into</i>
<i>an exquisite flying machine.</i>

245
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,208
The seed is another kind or ark,

246
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:51,110
ensuring the survival
of its species

247
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:54,614
by riding the currents of the
atmosphere to safe harbors.

248
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:57,984
Each seed
in its DNA carries a story,

249
00:15:58,018 --> 00:16:01,187
the character and destiny
of the next dandelion--

250
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:04,991
life propagates
by retelling its story.

251
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:10,296
<i>Is it possible that life</i>
<i>could survive the journey</i>

252
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,298
<i>from star to star?</i>

253
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:15,168
The stars are about
a million times farther apart

254
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:17,737
from each other
than are the planets.

255
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:21,674
Space is so vast that it would
take billions of years

256
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,543
for a rock ejected
from the Earth

257
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:28,314
to collide with a planet
circling another star.

258
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:31,317
Any stowaway microbes
would never survive

259
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:33,653
the cosmic radiation
for that long.

260
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:35,555
But there's a plausible scenario

261
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,392
for how life could spread from
one solar system to another.

262
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:47,500
<i>The stars of the Milky Way</i>
<i>are drawn by gravity</i>

263
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:51,738
<i>in their own enormous orbits</i>
<i>around its center.</i>

264
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:53,673
<i>Our Sun, for example,</i>

265
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:58,378
<i>takes some 225 million years</i>
<i>to complete a single orbit.</i>

266
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:01,614
<i>During each revolution around</i>
<i>the galaxy,</i>

267
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:04,617
<i>our solar system will</i>
<i>pass through two or three</i>

268
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:07,053
<i>gigantic interstellar clouds,</i>

269
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:10,757
<i>each of them</i>
<i>many light years across.</i>

270
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:18,531
<i>Galaxies are</i>
<i>world-making machines.</i>

271
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:22,201
<i>Our Milky Way has more than</i>
<i>100 of these vast clouds,</i>

272
00:17:22,236 --> 00:17:24,804
<i>a place where gas and dust</i>
<i>condense</i>

273
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:27,473
<i>to form new stars and planets.</i>

274
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:33,146
In its travels
through the Milky Way,

275
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,149
<i>our Sun is accompanied not only</i>
<i>by its planets,</i>

276
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:39,686
<i>but also by</i>
<i>a trillion distant comets.</i>

277
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:44,958
<i>When our solar system passes</i>
<i>through an interstellar cloud,</i>

278
00:17:44,992 --> 00:17:47,260
<i>the gravity of</i>
<i>the massive cloud</i>

279
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:50,964
<i>stirs up the outermost comets.</i>

280
00:17:50,998 --> 00:17:53,766
<i>Some comets will be hurled out</i>

281
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:56,336
<i>into the space</i>
<i>between the stars.</i>

282
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:00,773
<i>Others will plunge inward...</i>

283
00:18:03,143 --> 00:18:05,645
<i>falling towards the Sun.</i>

284
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:24,831
<i>And some of them may collide</i>
<i>with the planets.</i>

285
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,936
<i>The high-speed impact</i>
<i>of a comet with a rocky planet</i>

286
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,373
<i>will launch boulders</i>
<i>like rockets into space.</i>

287
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:36,276
<i>If that planet should</i>
<i>happen to be inhabited,</i>

288
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,978
<i>many of those rocks</i>
<i>will carry passengers--</i>

289
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,314
<i>living microbes.</i>

290
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:43,283
<i>After thousands of years,</i>

291
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:45,618
<i>fragments of the rocks</i>
<i>ejected from Earth</i>

292
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:50,056
<i>can fall as meteors into the</i>
<i>atmospheres of newborn planets</i>

293
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,325
<i>in the interstellar cloud.</i>

294
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:00,833
<i>If the stowaway microbes</i>

295
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:03,703
<i>should happen to come</i>
<i>in contact with liquid water,</i>

296
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:07,307
<i>they can revive and reproduce.</i>

297
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:09,976
<i>This may be</i>
<i>how life comes barreling</i>

298
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,345
<i>into the barren places.</i>

299
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:14,881
The sun emerges from the cloud,

300
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:16,516
having scattered
the seeds of life

301
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,153
among the newborn worlds
of other stars.

302
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:23,223
Those new worlds,
now touched by life,

303
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:24,824
will then leave
their birth cloud

304
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:27,026
and go their separate ways.

305
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:29,495
Eventually, their stars
will carry them

306
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,930
through
other interstellar clouds,

307
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:34,767
where they may seed
still more new worlds.

308
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:40,240
<i>Imagine this process</i>
<i>repeated from world to world,</i>

309
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:43,443
<i>each one bringing life</i>
<i>to others.</i>

310
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,419
Life would then propagate,
like a slow chain reaction,

311
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:55,788
through the entire galaxy.

312
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:04,464
<i>This could be</i>
<i>how life came to Earth.</i>

313
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:06,466
<i>We do not know for sure.</i>

314
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,136
Are there any beings
out there like us?

315
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,105
Do they ask the same questions?

316
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:13,806
Do they share our fears?

317
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:16,776
Do they have heroes
and adventures?

318
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:25,985
If they do exist,
where are they?

319
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,521
How might they make
their presence known?

320
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:47,974
How did we first announce
our presence to the galaxy?

321
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:53,680
It was 1946, the year after
the Second World War ended.

322
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:58,284
<i>The vivid imaginations</i>

323
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,119
<i>of HG Wells and Buck Rogers</i>

324
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:02,021
<i>never cooked up a more</i>
<i>fantastic experience</i>

325
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:04,624
<i>than the Army engineers</i>

326
00:21:04,658 --> 00:21:06,826
<i>at their laboratory</i>
<i>in Belmar, New Jersey.</i>

327
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:08,828
<i>It opens up</i>
<i>unlimited possibilities</i>

328
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:10,663
<i>for interstellar experiment.</i>

329
00:21:10,698 --> 00:21:11,931
<i>American engineers</i>

330
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:14,534
<i>bounced a beam</i>
<i>of radio waves off the Moon,</i>

331
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:16,769
<i>and were able</i>
<i>to detect its echo.</i>

332
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:26,546
<i>They called this experiment</i>
<i>Project Diana.</i>

333
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,214
<i>It was the first</i>
<i>interstellar message</i>

334
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:30,283
<i>ever sent by our species...</i>

335
00:21:32,753 --> 00:21:34,754
<i>an eerie, tolling bell.</i>

336
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:40,160
If one allows
the imagination free reign,

337
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:43,396
many future
possibilities appear.

338
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:48,201
Spaceships, carrying passengers

339
00:21:48,235 --> 00:21:50,136
at thousands of miles per hour,

340
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:52,038
can be controlled

341
00:21:52,072 --> 00:21:54,207
and communication established

342
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:55,909
with their passengers,

343
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:58,578
for we now know that
the Earth's atmosphere

344
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:00,447
can be penetrated.

345
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,354
<i>Traveling at</i>
<i>the speed of light,</i>

346
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:09,689
<i>it takes just over one second</i>

347
00:22:09,723 --> 00:22:11,891
<i>for a radio wave</i>
<i>to reach the lunar surface.</i>

348
00:22:13,461 --> 00:22:17,363
<i>But the expanding wavefront</i>
<i>is much bigger than the Moon.</i>

349
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:19,899
<i>Most of the wave</i>
<i>passes right by it,</i>

350
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:22,302
<i>but the central part</i>
<i>gets bounced back.</i>

351
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:27,173
<i>After a round-trip travel time</i>
<i>of two and a half seconds,</i>

352
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,541
<i>it hits our planet.</i>

353
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:31,945
<i>Project Diana transmitted</i>

354
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:33,747
<i>a series of powerful</i>
<i>radio waves--</i>

355
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:35,181
<i>one every four seconds--</i>

356
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:37,350
<i>to "ping" the Moon.</i>

357
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,223
<i>The parts that missed the Moon</i>
<i>are traveling still.</i>

358
00:22:45,993 --> 00:22:47,894
<i>It was just the beginning.</i>

359
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:49,462
<i>After World War II,</i>

360
00:22:49,497 --> 00:22:52,565
<i>television stations cropped up</i>
<i>all over the United States,</i>

361
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,900
<i>and other parts of the world.</i>

362
00:22:55,636 --> 00:22:57,437
<i>The Project Diana message</i>

363
00:22:57,471 --> 00:23:00,407
<i>and the FM radio, television</i>
<i>and radar signals</i>

364
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:01,875
<i>of the 20th century</i>

365
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:03,910
<i>all move outward</i>
<i>at the speed of light.</i>

366
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:08,214
<i>These transmissions make up</i>
<i>a vast sphere of radio waves,</i>

367
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:11,251
<i>expanding away from the Earth</i>
<i>in all directions.</i>

368
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:13,286
<i>You could say that our world</i>

369
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,423
<i>is radiating stories.</i>

370
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:19,592
<i>Our ancestors etched</i>
<i>the story of Gilgamesh</i>

371
00:23:19,627 --> 00:23:21,428
<i>into clay tablets,</i>

372
00:23:21,462 --> 00:23:24,397
<i>sending that epic tale</i>
<i>into the future.</i>

373
00:23:24,432 --> 00:23:27,267
<i>We've encoded our stories</i>
<i>in radio waves</i>

374
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:29,169
<i>and beamed them into space.</i>

375
00:23:29,203 --> 00:23:31,738
<i>They cover one light-year</i>
<i>of distance--</i>

376
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:34,107
<i>that's six trillion miles--</i>

377
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:36,576
<i>for every year of time</i>
<i>since they were sent.</i>

378
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,079
<i>We've been sending</i>
<i>our stories into space</i>

379
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:40,914
<i>for over 70 years.</i>

380
00:23:40,948 --> 00:23:42,582
<i>The leading edge</i>
<i>of these signals</i>

381
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:44,284
<i>has already washed over</i>

382
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:46,586
<i>thousands of planets</i>
<i>of other stars.</i>

383
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,688
<i>If any of these worlds are home</i>

384
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:51,257
<i>to a civilization</i>
<i>with radio telescopes,</i>

385
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:54,194
<i>they could already know</i>
<i>that we're here.</i>

386
00:23:57,565 --> 00:23:59,799
<i>What if other worlds</i>
<i>are sending</i>

387
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:01,835
<i>their stories into space?</i>

388
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:05,839
<i>Since 1960,</i>
<i>we've been listening</i>

389
00:24:05,873 --> 00:24:07,974
<i>for extraterrestrial</i>
<i>radio signals</i>

390
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:11,277
<i>without hearing so much</i>
<i>as a tolling bell.</i>

391
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:13,980
<i>But our search</i>
<i>has been sporadic</i>

392
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:16,216
<i>and limited to</i>
<i>certain parts of the sky.</i>

393
00:24:21,355 --> 00:24:22,822
<i>For all we know,</i>

394
00:24:22,857 --> 00:24:25,492
<i>we may have just missed</i>
<i>an alien signal,</i>

395
00:24:25,526 --> 00:24:27,060
<i>looking in the wrong place</i>

396
00:24:27,094 --> 00:24:29,229
<i>at the wrong time.</i>

397
00:24:29,263 --> 00:24:31,364
<i>We've only listened to</i>
<i>a miniscule fraction</i>

398
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:33,066
<i>of the stars in our galaxy.</i>

399
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,734
<i>And there may be</i>
<i>another problem...</i>

400
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:36,569
<i>we are, to some extent,</i>

401
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:38,538
<i>prisoners of our own</i>
<i>moment in time</i>

402
00:24:38,572 --> 00:24:40,473
<i>and the limits</i>
<i>of our technology.</i>

403
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:42,976
<i>Radio and television</i>
<i>broadcasting</i>

404

<i>may be only</i>
<i>a brief passing phase</i>

405
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:48,081
<i>in our technological</i>
<i>development.</i>

406
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:50,817
<i>When we imagine</i>
<i>alien civilizations</i>

407
00:24:50,851 --> 00:24:53,253
<i>broadcasting signals</i>
<i>with radio telescopes,</i>

408
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:56,489
<i>are we any different</i>
<i>from earlier generations</i>

409
00:24:56,524 --> 00:25:00,026
<i>who imagined riding</i>
<i>cannon shells to the Moon?</i>

410
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:04,464
<i>Civilizations even slightly</i>
<i>more advanced than ours</i>

411
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:06,099
<i>may have already moved on</i>

412
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:08,835
<i>to some other mode</i>
<i>of communication,</i>

413
00:25:08,837 --> 00:25:10,737
<i>one that we have</i>
<i>yet to discover</i>

414
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,739
<i>or even imagine.</i>

415
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:14,307
<i>Their messages could be</i>

416
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:16,076
<i>swirling around us,</i>
<i>at this very moment,</i>

417
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:19,746
<i>but we lack the means</i>
<i>to perceive them,</i>

418
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:21,514
<i>just as all of our ancestors,</i>

419
00:25:21,516 --> 00:25:23,283
<i>up to a little more</i>
<i>than a century ago,</i>

420
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:26,486
<i>would have been oblivious to</i>
<i>the most urgent radio signal</i>

421
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:29,356
<i>from another world.</i>

422
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:32,525
<i>But there's another,</i>
<i>more troubling possibility--</i>

423
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:35,295
<i>civilizations,</i>
<i>like other living things,</i>

424
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:38,031
<i>may only live so long</i>
<i>before perishing</i>

425
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:40,300
<i>due to natural causes,</i>
<i>or violence,</i>

426
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:42,635
<i>or self-inflicted wounds.</i>

427
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,971
<i>Whether or not</i>
<i>we ever make contact</i>

428
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:46,406
<i>with intelligent alien life</i>

429
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,875
<i>may depend on</i>
<i>a critical question.</i>

430
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:53,013
<i>What is the life expectancy</i>
<i>of a civilization?</i>

431
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:19,095
<i>By the time of Enheduanna,</i>

432
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,331
<i>the first person</i>
<i>to ever get a writing credit,</i>

433
00:26:21,365 --> 00:26:24,434
<i>civilization was already</i>
<i>more than 1,000 years old.</i>

434
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,774
But today, her glorious city
is a barren wasteland.

435
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:32,208
What went wrong?

436
00:26:32,243 --> 00:26:34,577
One problem was
the almost ceaseless warfare

437
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:36,846
between the cities
of Mesopotamia,

438
00:26:36,881 --> 00:26:39,516
which continually destroyed
their achievements.

439
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,684
They glorified military conquest

440
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:45,121
and ultimately
became its victims.

441
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:49,592
<i>Another cause of decline</i>

442
00:26:49,627 --> 00:26:51,294
<i>was that their</i>
<i>technical know-how</i>

443
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:53,763
<i>overran their</i>
<i>understanding of nature.</i>

444
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:56,466
<i>The ingenious irrigation system</i>
<i>that was the basis</i>

445
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,968
<i>for the great civilizations</i>
<i>of Mesopotamia</i>

446
00:26:59,003 --> 00:27:00,937
<i>had an unintended consequence--</i>

447
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:04,307
<i>the water channeled into</i>
<i>their farmlands every year</i>

448
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:07,944
<i>evaporated and left</i>
<i>its salt behind.</i>

449
00:27:07,978 --> 00:27:10,547
<i>Over generations,</i>
<i>the salt accumulated</i>

450
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:12,382
<i>and began to kill the crops.</i>

451
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:15,652
<i>And then, about 2,200 BC,</i>

452
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:17,987
<i>not long after</i>
<i>the time of Enheduanna,</i>

453
00:27:18,022 --> 00:27:19,923
<i>disaster struck...</i>

454
00:27:19,957 --> 00:27:23,059
<i>a drought of truly</i>
<i>epic proportions,</i>

455
00:27:23,094 --> 00:27:24,627
<i>lasting for many decades.</i>

456
00:27:24,662 --> 00:27:26,563
<i>The rains stopped,</i>
<i>crops withered,</i>

457
00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:28,064
<i>and there was famine</i>
<i>and anarchy.</i>

458
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:29,899
<i>Barbarians invaded.</i>

459
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:33,570
<i>The streets of many cities</i>
<i>were littered with dead.</i>

460
00:27:33,604 --> 00:27:35,472
<i>There could be only</i>
<i>one explanation.</i>

461
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:37,474
<i>Enlil, the supreme god,</i>

462
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:40,076
<i>was angry because</i>
<i>one of his temples</i>

463
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:41,578
<i>had been destroyed.</i>

464
00:27:41,612 --> 00:27:44,914
<i>The people of Mesopotamia</i>
<i>could not know</i>

465
00:27:44,949 --> 00:27:46,649
<i>that the same drought</i>
<i>was crushing</i>

466
00:27:46,684 --> 00:27:48,618
<i>the dawning civilizations</i>
<i>of Egypt,</i>

467
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:50,253
<i>Greece, India,</i>

468
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:51,955
<i>Pakistan and China.</i>

469
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:53,656
<i>All the gods of the Earth</i>

470
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:56,593
<i>must have been really angry</i>
<i>about something.</i>

471
00:27:56,627 --> 00:27:58,028
<i>For all their brilliance,</i>

472
00:27:58,062 --> 00:27:59,696
<i>the people of</i>
<i>those civilizations</i>

473
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,931
<i>had no inkling</i>
<i>they were experiencing</i>

474
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:04,167
<i>abrupt climate change.</i>

475
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,306
<i>3,000 years later, the climate</i>

476
00:28:10,341 --> 00:28:13,276
<i>would change abruptly for</i>
<i>another glorious civilization,</i>

477
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,378
<i>this one in Central America.</i>

478
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:16,813
<i>At its peak,</i>

479
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,982
<i>the Mayan civilization</i>
<i>perished,</i>

480
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:21,484
<i>wiped out by a series</i>
<i>of severe droughts</i>

481
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:22,886
<i>over the course of a century.</i>

482
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,388
<i>We still carry within us</i>

483
00:28:25,423 --> 00:28:28,124
<i>the echoes of these</i>
<i>extinct civilizations</i>

484
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,860
<i>in our languages and our myths.</i>

485
00:28:30,895 --> 00:28:34,798
<i>Today, we have a single</i>
<i>global civilization.</i>

486
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:36,633
<i>How long will it live?</i>

487
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:40,203
<i>There are so many ways</i>
<i>for a civilization to die.</i>

488
00:28:40,237 --> 00:28:41,638
Let's start with the ones

489
00:28:41,672 --> 00:28:43,673
that we probably wouldn't
be able to do much about.

490
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,512
<i>That supernova</i>
<i>is 1,000 light-years away.</i>

491
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:51,681
<i>If it were much closer, say...</i>

492
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:54,184
<i>less than 30 light-years</i>
<i>from Earth,</i>

493
00:28:54,218 --> 00:28:56,486
<i>its cosmic radiation</i>
<i>would shred</i>

494
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,555
<i>the atmosphere's</i>
<i>protective ozone layer</i>

495
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:00,757
and destroy our civilization.

496
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:04,260
Lucky for us, none of the stars
close enough to harm us

497
00:29:04,295 --> 00:29:06,029
are likely to go supernova

498
00:29:06,063 --> 00:29:08,431
any time in the next
few hundred million years.

499
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:16,172
<i>Every million years or so,</i>

500
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:19,909
<i>a supervolcano erupts</i>
<i>somewhere on Earth.</i>

501
00:29:19,944 --> 00:29:24,214
<i>The last time it happened</i>
<i>was 74,000 years ago,</i>

502
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:25,715
<i>on the island of Sumatra,</i>

503
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,618
<i>in what is now Indonesia.</i>

504
00:29:28,653 --> 00:29:30,553
<i>It spewed</i>
<i>hundreds of times more</i>

505
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:32,522
<i>rock, ash and toxic gas</i>

506
00:29:32,556 --> 00:29:35,725
<i>than any single volcano</i>
<i>in recorded history.</i>

507
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,129
<i>The molten rock that erupted</i>
<i>from Earth's crust</i>

508
00:29:39,163 --> 00:29:41,031
<i>left this caldera,</i>

509
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:42,766
<i>100 kilometers long,</i>

510
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,935
<i>now filled with a lake.</i>

511
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:52,709
<i>The Toba volcano sent</i>
<i>more than 600 cubic miles</i>

512
00:29:52,743 --> 00:29:55,745
<i>of pulverized rock</i>
<i>soaring skyward.</i>

513
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,583
<i>The westward wind carried the</i>
<i>volcanic ash over India,</i>

514
00:29:59,617 --> 00:30:01,651
<i>where it fell out</i>
<i>in a smothering blanket</i>

515
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:04,454
<i>over the subcontinent.</i>

516
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:07,057
<i>The eruption loaded</i>
<i>the upper atmosphere</i>

517
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:08,792
<i>with sulfur gases.</i>

518
00:30:08,826 --> 00:30:10,760
<i>The result was a global haze</i>

519
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:12,662
<i>that blocked most</i>
<i>of the sunlight</i>

520
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:15,231
<i>from reaching the surface</i>
<i>for at least five years.</i>

521
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:18,535
<i>It was like one</i>
<i>five-year-long cloudy day.</i>

522
00:30:19,804 --> 00:30:22,639
<i>This so-called</i>
<i>"volcanic winter"</i>

523
00:30:22,673 --> 00:30:26,676
<i>resembled a "nuclear winter,"</i>
<i>but without the radiation.</i>

524
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:30,146
Temperatures fell everywhere.

525
00:30:30,181 --> 00:30:32,782
Plants and animals froze
even in the tropics,

526
00:30:32,817 --> 00:30:34,684
dying in enormous numbers.

527
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,186
But life is hardy.

528
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,256
Only a few species
were driven to extinction.

529
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,825
One of our ancestors
in central India

530
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:43,260
sharpened this stone blade

531
00:30:43,294 --> 00:30:45,662
in the years before
the Toba eruption.

532
00:30:45,696 --> 00:30:47,831
And this blade

533
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:49,432
was one of dozens
that were found

534
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:52,102
in the soil layer
above the volcanic fallout.

535
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:54,604
This tells us that
some toolmakers,

536
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:57,140
even in the area directly
affected by the volcano,

537
00:30:57,174 --> 00:30:59,276
managed to survive
the cataclysm.

538
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,845
But the global human population

539
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:04,147
must have plummeted
before rebounding.

540
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:07,150
If an eruption like this
were to happen tomorrow,

541
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:09,953
our civilization
would be brought to its knees,

542
00:31:09,987 --> 00:31:13,223
although the human species
would survive.

543
00:31:15,493 --> 00:31:17,627
I can imagine that
our technology

544
00:31:17,662 --> 00:31:19,329
of a few hundred years from now

545
00:31:19,363 --> 00:31:20,830
would allow us to siphon off

546
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:22,866
the energy of
a threatening supervolcano

547
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,701
before it explodes.

548
00:31:24,735 --> 00:31:27,204
We could then use that energy
for our own purposes.

549
00:31:27,238 --> 00:31:30,006
About once every million years,
a small asteroid

550
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,641
<i>collides with the Earth,</i>

551
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:34,044
<i>causing a similar amount</i>
<i>of devastation.</i>

552
00:31:34,078 --> 00:31:36,079
<i>With our current science</i>
<i>and technology,</i>

553
00:31:36,113 --> 00:31:39,015
<i>we already know how to prevent</i>
<i>an asteroid impact.</i>

554
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,084
<i>We would see it coming</i>
<i>years in advance</i>

555
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:42,719
<i>and could send</i>
<i>a spacecraft there</i>

556
00:31:42,753 --> 00:31:45,021
<i>to deflect it into</i>
<i>a harmless orbit.</i>

557
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:47,090
With the technology
of a thousand years from now,

558
00:31:47,124 --> 00:31:49,926
we might even be able
to mitigate the deadly effects

559
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:52,863
of a nearby supernova
on Earth's atmosphere.

560
00:31:52,897 --> 00:31:55,031
But what happens

561
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:57,501
when the danger
to a civilization is invisible?

562
00:31:57,535 --> 00:31:59,236
When no one can see it coming?

563
00:32:08,604 --> 00:32:09,904
<i>Beginning with Columbus,</i>

564
00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:12,007
<i>the European invaders</i>
<i>of the Americas</i>

565
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:15,910
had a secret weapon that even
they knew nothing about.

566
00:32:15,945 --> 00:32:18,847
<i>They were carrying</i>
<i>bacteria and viruses</i>

567
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:20,982
<i>for deadly diseases,</i>
<i>such as smallpox,</i>

568
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:24,919
<i>that the original Americans</i>
<i>had never been exposed to.</i>

569
00:32:24,954 --> 00:32:26,921
<i>The Europeans like to believe</i>

570
00:32:26,956 --> 00:32:28,957
<i>that it was their valor</i>
<i>and superior weapons</i>

571
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,826
<i>and culture</i>
<i>that won them the New World.</i>

572
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:34,095
<i>The real conquistadors were</i>

573
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,364
<i>the armies of the pathogens</i>
<i>that raced on ahead</i>

574
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,201
<i>to infect and kill nine out</i>
<i>of ten of all the Indians</i>

575
00:32:40,236 --> 00:32:43,004
<i>of North, Central</i>
<i>and South America.</i>

576
00:32:44,674 --> 00:32:46,441
<i>The great civilizations</i>
<i>of the New World</i>

577
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:49,945
<i>crumbled under the onslaught</i>
<i>of invading microbes.</i>

578
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:51,980
<i>Without his invisible army,</i>

579
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,049
<i>Cortez and those who followed</i>

580
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:57,852
<i>might never</i>
<i>have stood a chance.</i>

581
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:01,389
But what about civilizations
that self-destruct?

582
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,200
<i>Our economic systems were</i>
<i>formed when the planet</i>

583
00:33:12,234 --> 00:33:15,070
<i>and its air, rivers,</i>
<i>oceans, lands,</i>

584
00:33:15,104 --> 00:33:18,873
<i>all seemed infinite.</i>

585
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:21,810
<i>They evolved long before</i>
<i>we first saw the Earth</i>

586
00:33:21,844 --> 00:33:25,513
<i>as the tiny organism</i>
<i>that it actually is.</i>

587
00:33:25,548 --> 00:33:27,182
<i>They're all alike</i>
<i>in one respect...</i>

588
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:28,850
<i>they're profit-driven,</i>

589
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:32,621
<i>and therefore,</i>
<i>focused on short-term gain.</i>

590
00:33:59,115 --> 00:34:01,116
<i>The prevailing</i>
<i>economic systems,</i>

591
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,618
<i>no matter what</i>
<i>their ideologies,</i>

592
00:34:03,653 --> 00:34:05,353
<i>have no built-in mechanisms</i>

593
00:34:05,388 --> 00:34:07,389
<i>for protecting our descendants</i>

594
00:34:07,423 --> 00:34:09,424
<i>of even 100 years from now,</i>

595
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:11,826
<i>let alone, 100,000.</i>

596
00:34:16,832 --> 00:34:18,800
In one respect, we're ahead

597
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:21,102
of the people
of Ancient Mesopotamia.

598
00:34:21,137 --> 00:34:25,073
Unlike them, we understand
what's happening to our world.

599
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:27,442
For example,
we're pumping greenhouse gasses

600
00:34:27,476 --> 00:34:30,045
into our atmosphere
at a rate not seen on Earth

601
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,546
for a million years.

602
00:34:31,581 --> 00:34:33,281
And the scientific consensus

603
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:35,483
that we're destabilizing
our climate.

604
00:34:35,518 --> 00:34:39,421
Yet our civilization seems
to be in the grip of denial;

605
00:34:39,455 --> 00:34:41,957
a kind of paralysis.

606
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:43,992
There's a disconnect
between what we know

607
00:34:44,026 --> 00:34:46,027
and what we do.

608
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:52,601
Being able to adapt
our behavior to challenges

609
00:34:52,635 --> 00:34:56,805
is as good a definition
of intelligence as any I know.

610
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,946
<i>If our greater intelligence</i>
<i>is the hallmark of our species,</i>

611
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:06,448
<i>then we should use it,</i>

612
00:35:06,482 --> 00:35:08,583
<i>as all other beings use their</i>
<i>distinctive advantages--</i>

613
00:35:08,618 --> 00:35:11,019
<i>to help ensure</i>
<i>that their offspring prosper,</i>

614
00:35:11,053 --> 00:35:13,288
<i>and their heredity</i>
<i>is passed on,</i>

615
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:17,659
<i>and that the fabric of nature</i>
<i>that sustains us is protected.</i>

616
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:20,495
<i>Human intelligence</i>
<i>is imperfect, surely,</i>

617
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,931
<i>and newly arisen.</i>

618
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:25,834
<i>The ease with which it can be</i>
<i>sweet-talked, overwhelmed,</i>

619
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:27,769
<i>or subverted by other</i>
<i>hard-wired tendencies,</i>

620
00:35:27,803 --> 00:35:31,706
<i>sometimes themselves disguised</i>
<i>as the light of reason,</i>

621
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:33,942
<i>is worrisome.</i>

622
00:35:33,976 --> 00:35:36,211
<i>But if our intelligence</i>
<i>is the only edge,</i>

623
00:35:36,245 --> 00:35:37,846
<i>we must learn to use it better.</i>

624
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,614
<i>To sharpen it.</i>

625
00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:41,950
<i>To understand its limitations</i>
<i>and deficiencies.</i>

626
00:35:41,984 --> 00:35:45,854
<i>To use it as cats use stealth</i>
<i>before pouncing.</i>

627
00:35:45,888 --> 00:35:48,456
<i>As walking sticks</i>
<i>use camouflage.</i>

628
00:35:48,491 --> 00:35:51,660
<i>To make it the tool</i>
<i>of our survival.</i>

629
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:53,728
<i>If we do this, we can solve</i>

630
00:35:53,763 --> 00:35:56,498
<i>almost any problem</i>
<i>we are likely to confront</i>

631
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:58,867
<i>in the next 100,000 years.</i>

632
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:07,642
<i>And now we've arrived</i>
<i>at the place</i>

633
00:36:07,677 --> 00:36:10,145
<i>where our ancient dreams</i>
<i>of immortality</i>

634
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:13,748
and modern astrophysics
converge.

635
00:36:13,783 --> 00:36:15,851
Giant elliptical galaxies

636
00:36:15,885 --> 00:36:18,386
are something like... Florida,

637
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:22,123
where the oldest stars
in the universe may be found.

638
00:36:27,864 --> 00:36:29,998
<i>This is a red dwarf star,</i>

639
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:32,701
<i>smaller and fainter</i>
<i>than our Sun.</i>

640
00:36:32,735 --> 00:36:37,205
<i>Red dwarfs are by far the most</i>
<i>plentiful stars in the cosmos.</i>

641
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,341
<i>Unlike the Sun, which is</i>
<i>halfway through</i>

642
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:41,343
<i>its 10-billion-year lifetime,</i>

643
00:36:41,377 --> 00:36:44,279
<i>red dwarfs will continue</i>
<i>to provide light and warmth</i>

644
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:47,215
<i>to their planets</i>
<i>for trillions of years.</i>

645
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,884
<i>That's hundreds of times longer</i>

646
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:52,020
<i>than the present age</i>
<i>of the universe.</i>

647
00:36:52,054 --> 00:36:53,855
<i>What would</i>
<i>intelligent beings do</i>

648
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,357
<i>if they had an eternity</i>

649
00:36:55,391 --> 00:36:58,693
<i>to develop their understanding</i>
<i>of the universe?</i>

650
00:36:58,728 --> 00:37:00,929
<i>Perhaps they would learn</i>
<i>how to open shortcuts</i>

651
00:37:00,963 --> 00:37:03,098
<i>in the fabric of spacetime,</i>

652
00:37:03,132 --> 00:37:05,033
<i>to travel between galaxies</i>

653
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:06,868
<i>faster than the speed of light.</i>

654
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:09,738
<i>Maybe they would create</i>
<i>whole new universes</i>

655
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:13,241
<i>as artistic</i>
<i>or scientific experiments.</i>

656
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:16,111
Of course no one,
or at least nobody on Earth,

657
00:37:16,145 --> 00:37:18,914
knows what
the immortals might do.

658
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:24,219
If one allows
the imagination free reign.

659
00:37:24,253 --> 00:37:25,921
But what about us?

660
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,293
What is our own future?

661
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:33,328
What would the Cosmic Calendar

662
00:37:33,362 --> 00:37:37,099
of the next 14 billion years
look like?

663
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,470
If the original Cosmic Calendar

664
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,973
includes all of time
from the birth of the universe

665
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,941
until this very moment...

666
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,844
what would
the Cosmic Calendar look like

667
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:04,648
for the next 14 billion years?

668
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:07,117
Just as with
the Cosmic Calendar of the past,

669
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,419
every month the future calendar

670
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,621
equals about a billion years;

671
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,558
every day, some 40 million.

672
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,629
Science makes it possible
for us to foretell

673
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,664
certain astronomical events

674
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,667
in the unimaginably
distant future--

675
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,969
the death of the Sun,
for example.

676
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,372
<i>In some five billion years,</i>

677
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,642
<i>our star will have</i>
<i>exhausted its hydrogen--</i>

678
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,710
<i>the nuclear fuel</i>
<i>that powers it--</i>

679
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,879
<i>becoming a red giant.</i>

680
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,948
<i>I know that sounds depressing,</i>

681
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,851
<i>but if we apply our</i>
<i>intelligence, our descendants</i>

682
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:43,954
<i>of that distant future</i>
<i>will have long departed</i>

683
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,790
<i>from the lost worlds</i>
<i>of the Sun.</i>

684
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,625
<i>Who knows?</i>

685
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,661
Human events entail
too many variables,

686
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,396
too many uncertainties,

687
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,965
to make scientific statements
about our future.

688
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,067
But we can still dream.

689
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,836
The next golden age
of human achievement

690
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,039
begins here and now--

691
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:06,009
<i>New Year's Day</i>
<i>of the next cosmic year.</i>

692
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:08,145
<i>In the first tenth of a second,</i>

693
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,415
<i>we take the vision</i>
<i>of the pale blue dot to heart,</i>

694
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:15,018
<i>and learn how to share this</i>
<i>tiny world with each other.</i>

695
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:17,020
The last
internal combustion engine

696
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:18,855
is placed in a museum,

697
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,658
as the effects of climate change
reverse and diminish.

698
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:25,529
<i>A fifth of a second</i>
<i>into this future</i>

699
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,498
<i>people will stop dying</i>
<i>from the effects of poverty.</i>

700
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,568
<i>The planet is now</i>
<i>a completely self-sustaining,</i>

701
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:34,004
<i>intercommunicating organism.</i>

702
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,073
<i>A half-second from now,</i>

703
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,708
the polar ice caps are restored

704
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,077
to the way they were
in the 19th century,

705
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,046
<i>and the forecast</i>
<i>is mild and pleasant</i>

706
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:45,349
<i>for the next cosmic</i>
<i>minute and a half--</i>

707
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,418
<i>40,000 years.</i>

708
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,587
<i>By the time</i>
<i>we are ready to settle</i>

709
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:53,290
<i>even the nearest</i>
<i>other planetary systems,</i>

710
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,126
<i>we will have changed.</i>

711
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,896
<i>The simple passage</i>
<i>of so many generations</i>

712
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,931
<i>will have changed us.</i>

713
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:04,368
<i>Necessity will have changed us.</i>

714
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,404
<i>We are an adaptable species.</i>

715
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,541
<i>It will not be we</i>
<i>who reach Alpha Centauri</i>

716
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,644
<i>and the other</i>
<i>nearby star systems</i>

717
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:15,746
<i>on our interstellar arks.</i>

718
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,382
<i>It will be a species</i>
<i>very like us,</i>

719
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,119
<i>but with more of our strengths</i>
<i>and fewer of our weaknesses;</i>

720
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,221
<i>more confident, far-seeing,</i>

721
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,957
<i>capable and wise.</i>

722
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,725
<i>For all our failings,</i>

723
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,228
<i>despite our flaws</i>
<i>and limitations,</i>

724
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,965
<i>we humans are capable</i>
<i>of greatness.</i>

725
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,235
<i>What new wonders,</i>
<i>undreamt of in our time,</i>

726
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,772
<i>will we have accomplished</i>
<i>in another generation...</i>

727
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,807
<i>and another?</i>

728
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:47,177
<i>How far will</i>
<i>our nomadic species</i>

729
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:50,747
<i>have wandered</i>
<i>by the end of the next century,</i>

730
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,617
<i>and the next millennium?</i>

731
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,086
<i>Our remote descendants,</i>

732
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,988
<i>safely arrayed on many worlds</i>

733
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,624
<i>throughout the solar system</i>
<i>and beyond,</i>

734
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,994
<i>will be unified</i>
<i>by their common heritage,</i>

735
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,464
<i>by their regard</i>
<i>for their home planet,</i>

736
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:11,168
<i>and by their knowledge that,</i>
<i>whatever other life may be,</i>

737
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,971
<i>the only humans</i>
<i>in all the universe</i>

738
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:17,140
<i>came from Earth.</i>

739
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:19,142
<i>They will gaze up</i>
<i>and strain to find</i>

740
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:21,945
<i>the blue dot in their skies.</i>

741
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,214
<i>They will marvel</i>
<i>at how vulnerable</i>

742
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:27,885
<i>the repository of all</i>
<i>our potential once was,</i>

743
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,787
<i>how perilous our infancy,</i>

744
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,892
<i>how humble our beginnings,</i>

745
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:37,828
<i>how many rivers</i>
<i>we had to cross...</i>

746
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,200
<i>before we found our way.</i>
